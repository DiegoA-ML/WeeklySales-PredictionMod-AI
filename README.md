# WeeklySales-PredictionMod-AI
Improved a weekly sales prediction model that featured a 60% error, resulting in inefficient inventory management and economic losses. In less than 3 weeks, my team and I developed several predictive models using machine learning techniques. We managed to reduce the sales prediction error to 9%, 4% and 0.4%.

Thanks to Tecnológico de Monterrey, we had the opportunity to collaborate with Don Colchon, a renowned mattress manufacturer. The challenge was to improve a weekly sales prediction model that had a 60% error, resulting in inefficient inventory management and economic losses. In less than 3 weeks, my team and I developed several predictive models using machine learning techniques. We managed to reduce the sales prediction error to 9%, 4% and 0.4%.   In our final presentation, we had the honor of presenting our results to Jose Sergio Serna Garza, the Operations Manager of Don Colchon. We are confident that our improvements will allow Don Colchon to optimize its inventory management and save significantly. This achievement would not have been possible without the guidance of our teachers, Dr. Rasikh Tariq and Rafael Martínez García Peña, and the efforts of my teammates: Raúl Correa Ocañas, Ricardo Kaleb Flores Alfonso, Ricardo Marín Perez y Daniel Ríos Zúñiga.
